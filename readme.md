## .files
My dotfiles. This structure is taken from [the excellent
walkthrough](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) written 
up by Nicola Paolucci on the Atlassian blog.

### Files

What this repository contains (for now):

- .zshrc: The theme and settings for my zsh configuration.
- .gitignore: My top level ignores.
- .vimrc: The vim plugins and mappings I use

Notably, this repository doesn't have my .gitconfig becaue I need to use
a seperate account for work and I don't want to share the competing sign-in
credentials.

I'm not yet totally happy with my settings in the above files. Once I get happy
with my versioning and package handling, I'll probably start to add in some of
the files related to that too.
